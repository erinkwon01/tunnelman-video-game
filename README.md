# tunnelman-video-game

- Developed an interactive survival game in C++ where the user moves the TunnelMan character through a board of dirt objects, picks up items, and fights enemy objects.
- Structured codebase using object-oriented programming for easy development and used 2D vectors, pointers, inheritance, polymorphism, and overloading to ensure a tractable time complexity.
- Tested functionality via manual play testing.
